# BicycleGame-JavaScript 
Bicycle Game created using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. 
Background attributes created with canvas and the movements of objects are controlled by JavaScript. With the update() function, objects are drawn on canvas and collision control is performed according to their position. If there is a collision, the player is warned with the message "game over" displayed on the screen. If there is no collision, obstacles are drawn to the road according to the elements of the lines[]. Each time, the location of the stones is determined by generating random numbers(0 or 1). The key that the user presses controlled by window.onkeydown = function(Hareket) and the bike moves up or down.
